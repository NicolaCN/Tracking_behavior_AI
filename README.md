# Tracking behaviors with AI
The goal of my part of the project is to investigate correlations between body motion features and brain activity (EEG) using LSTM and explainable AI 
techniques.
The project is conducted by the computer Science department at INSA Lyon, in collaboration with the neuroscience department of Lyon 1
